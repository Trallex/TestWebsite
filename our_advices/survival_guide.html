       <h1>Food & Drinks</h1>
       <h2>Buying food</h2>
       <p>The easiest way to cook cheap is with the help of your housemates. When you prepare food together, not only you use less electricity and water, but buy bigger packages of food. They are usually much cheaper than small ones. <br>
       In Covilh√£, you can drink water from sink, or as we had in our house - water from mines. Making tea in big containers is also nice way to have something tasty to drink.</p>
       <h2>Preparing dishes</h2>
       <p>
       When you are student, rice with vegetables and pasta with tomato pulp are your best friends. They are cheap, and satiating. Moreover, with a bit of creativity you can add some ingredients to change the taste. For example if you will add beans, corn and hot spices to pulp with rice, you have mexican-style dinner. Adding coconut milk and curry will chage the dish to more oriental style.<br>
       You can still use bread which was laying too long. Just slice them, add few onion rings, ham, cheese and olives/corn/whatever-you-like, and place them into hot oven for few minutes. After that put some ketchup or mayonnaise. Easy and tasty supper. </p>

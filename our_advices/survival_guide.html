       <h1>Food & Drinks</h1>
       
           <h2>Buying food</h2>
               <p>The easiest way to cook cheap is with the help of your housemates. When you prepare food together, not only you use less electricity and water, but buy bigger packages of food. They are usually much cheaper than small ones. <br>
               In Covilhã, you can drink water from sink, or as we had in our house - water from mines. Making tea in big containers is also nice way to have something tasty to drink.</p>

           <h2>Preparing dishes</h2>
               <p>
               When you are student, rice with vegetables and pasta with tomato pulp are your best friends. They are cheap, and satiating. Moreover, with a bit of creativity you can add some ingredients to change the taste. For example if you will add beans, corn and hot spices to pulp with rice, you have mexican-style dinner. Adding coconut milk and curry will chage the dish to more oriental style.<br>
               You can still use bread which was laying too long. Just slice them, add few onion rings, ham, cheese and olives/corn/whatever-you-like, and place them into hot oven for few minutes. After that put some ketchup or mayonnaise. Easy and tasty supper. </p>
       
       <h1>Parties</h1>
           <p>In Covilhã there are are few places to party, but important thing is, to enter some, you need to pay or pay extra. To make the cost as low as possible, we recommend to buy the entrance fee before. The fee is lower than at the day of the party. You'll receive special bracelet to confirm that you already paid.</p>
           
           
        <h1>Medicine</h1>
            <p>Drugs are expensive, so bringing some painkillers, medicines for fever or diarrhea from your home can save you some money.
            Some health suplements like magnesium or vitamin C also can keep you healty.
            Here are some home solutions while you'll get sick:
            </p>   
            <ul>
                <li>When you'll have a runny nose, you can pour some boiling water to a bowl, add some salt, and then breathe the salty steam. It's easier when you cover your head with a towel.</li>
                <li>The black tea with lemon jucie, ginger and honey is perfect cure for flu.</li>
                <li>If you don't mind the taste, onion juice is also good solution.</li>
            </ul>

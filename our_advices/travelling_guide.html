      <h1>Travelling guide</h1>
        <h2>Paid options</h2>
        <h3>Big cities:</h3>
        <p>
            When you are in big city in Portugal, like Lisbon or Porto, there are many ways to travel through (or to the other) city.<br> You can use buses, trams and metro to move through city. Tickets are not very expensive, below 2€. Sometimes it's better to buy time-limited ticetks.<br>
            Trains, airplains and intercity buses are the most common and easy way to reach other cities, prices are not that bad, for example bus from Lisbon to Covilhã is ofen below 20€.
        </p>
        <h3>Small cities:</h3>
        <p>
            Smaller towns, like our beloved Covilhã, do not have trams nor metros. There are some buses, but they are 
            not so often. We used them while we needed to move to other vilages. Fortunately town is very small, so we could walk by foot and rent taxies only when we needed car to move havy stuff, like while moving in or after big shopping. The price if fair: 1€/person to travel anywhere in town.
        </p>
        <h2>Hitchhiking</h2>
        <p>If you like meeting new people, enjoy the thrill of adventure or just don't want to spend money, you can always hitchhike. Locals are very kind, so it's not a problem to get a cardboard and borrow something to write to make a sign. <br> All you need to know are the roads to your destination. You may use your phone or regular map. Then, you just go to entrance to big road,like highway, and find place where cars don't move so fast and can stop, like exit from roundabouts. Of course if you are trying to catch a ride out of the city, you can walk on the side of street to slowly make progress. <u>JUST REMEMBER TO BE CAREFUL!</u><br>
        You can also use this advices:
         </p>
         <p>
         <ul>
            <li>Split to small groups, pairs are optimal, but group of three may still work.<br>P.S. Drivers prefer if the pair is mixed, two guys seem to be more dangerous for them. ;)</li>
            <li>Keep smiling, you would seem much interesting and pleasant co-passanger. </li>
            <li>Make your cardboard eye catching, use color markers insted of regular pen. You can also wear funny clothes, dance, etc, to make yourself being noticed easier. </li>
            <li>Try to catch rides when the traffic is big, like when people drive to work or back from it.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
        
    <h2>Sightseeing</h2>
       <p>If you want to see something more than your university and district you'll live in, we recommend you to ask locals. They are very kind and surely will tell you about some interesting places. <br>
       Here is the list of places we (or our other Erasmus+ friends) have personally been and recommend:
       </p>
       <p>
       <ul>
           <li>Lisbon and Porto - two major cities. You'll probably fly to one of this cities, so consider staying there for few days to discover them. Some of our friends liked them so much, so they get there just to party, like for New Years Eve. </li>
           <li>Sintra - small town with colorful, beautiful palace.</li>
           <li>Belmonte - small town with castle and specific vibe. Perfect for one-day trip.</li>
           <li>Algavre region - it's good to go there while it's hot, to lay on the beaches, swim in the ocean and sunbathe.</li>
           <li>Azores - volcanic islands on Pacific Ocean.</li>
           <li>Marocco - the country in Africa, close to Portugal, cheap (with tickets and for living), completely different than European countries, yet not so wild.</li>
       </ul>

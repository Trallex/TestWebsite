      <h1>Before Erasmus</h1>
          
          <h2>What do you need to get on Erasmus+?</h2>
              <p>
                   To get on Erasmus+ program, at first you need to search for partnership university, which you want to apply. The list of universities should be available at the website of your IMO (International Mobility Office). This choice is not the easiest one, because you need to find suitable subjects in language you know (or support in this language). <br>
                    Universities websites are not always translated fully to English, so sometimes you'll need to contact their IMO coordinator. <br>
                    It's also quite important to have good grades. 
                    You need to deliver transcript of your records to the head of your faculty and university you are applying on. Of course you need to know at least one foreign language to study abroad. But don't worry, you don't need to be a native speaker. <br>
                    You also need to have foreign currency account to receive scholarship.
              </p>
          <h2>Recruitment process</h2>
              <p>
                  The specific info you need is in your International Mobility Office.
              </p>
          <h2>Planning your voyage</h2>
              <p>
                   It's really important to buy the insurance before you leave. Even if you have an European Health Insurance Card, it's better to have the extra one, which will provide you some cash in case of accident. The Euro26 has nice options, and you'll have some special discounts at places like museums with it. <br>
                    Though you don't know when semester will start, it's good to buy your ticket in advance. It will be much cheaper. It's good to come before the term has already started, so estime like 2 weeks to settle. <br>
                    
              </p>
          <h2>After you arrive</h2>
              <p>
                  When you arrive, the key part is to go to the IMO, where you can settle things with your paperwork. Without the confirmation of the university, you wont receive the scholarship. <br>
                  You have also an option to get the ESN card, which can give you discounts at many places, not only in your city. The best profit are the Ryanair flights, they have -15% on the price and free 20kg luggage.

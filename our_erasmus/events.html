       <h1>Events</h1>
       <h2>Festival de Cherovia</h2>
       <p>In the beginning of our mobility in Portugal there was the local festival at 20th of September. 
       Initially we thought that it was nothing interesting, just an ordinary family event. </p>
       <p>The main purpose of the event was spreading new recipes for the dishes based on parsnip. 
       Festival had place in the historical centre of Covilha. Students bands were performing on the stage playing 
       tradtional portuguese music. There was also a contest for the best dish and decoration made from parsnip.</p>
       <p>Whole festival lasted three days, three days of exploring our new home city, meeting new Erasmus people (and not only), 
       discover traditions and tastes of Portugal. They say that Covilha is a students city but during these days streets were full 
       of families. We were shocked that elder Portuguese people are so good partymates.</p>
       <h2>Erasmus Week</h2>
       <p>After the beginning of the academic year there was an Erasmus Week started from Welcome Session. During that 
       period ESN was preparing a lots of activities for exchange students. We were not able to participate in every of them, nevertheless  
       we really enjoyed it. 
       <p>In andition to parties such where everyone was making new friends, we took part in some more "active" events.
       Among others, we participated in Treasure Hunt. The clue of the game was reach every point of our city which was marked on the list. 
       We had to took group photos with these characteristic places. That was not the easiest task, becuse of no ability to speak in portuguese
       we could only trust our memory and instinct. To our suprise, we managed it really well and we finished the game as second team. 
       Maybe the game was nothing innovative but we enjoyed it as we had done it as a children. We discovered a lot of interesing places and 
       beutiful murals in Covilha. We also won the prize in the form of baskec full of traditional portuguese products.</p>
       <p>ESN arranged also international dinner. It had placed in Biri Night bar. Every student was obligated to make their own traditional 
        dish from their country. Most of polish people cooked traditional pancakes with apples or dumplings. We made 
        a typical polish salad. Brazilians could show off with their delicious dessert called "brigadeiro" which is really simple to make but none 
        of us had heard about it before. Turkish sudents were feeding us with spicy tastes of their couisine. Italians did not have to make a big 
        effort to make everyone lovers of their dishes. After this event we were really full, full of the food but also full of curiosity to explore 
        tastes of world.  
       </p>
       <h2>Latada</h2>
       <p>Here in Beira Interior region univeristies are really traditional. Firstly when we came here we were a little bit shocked seeing a group 
           of people climbing upwards with a mixture of eggs and flour on their heads. Here, in Portugal is normal that they make this kind of rituals 
        on the 1st year students. We heard a lot about freshmen weeks in other countries but not about the freshmen month! But after this priod there is the 
        time to make the freshman a legitimate student. 
        <p>So there is organised huge event that is starting from Serenata which is quite nostalgic and it is 
        a symbol of a new level. Afterwards there is a huge freshmen students parade. Every faculty has the occasion to present theirself.
        They are making a large conctractions connected with their specializations. Every studens is wearing a  special costume made by theirself according to the rules
        and colours of the faculty. Freshmens are skandalizing and singing, also other students are giving them the special drink, as a ritual, when they are kneeling.
         After this 1st year students are allowed to wear a traditional UBI outfit with characteristic cape.</p>
